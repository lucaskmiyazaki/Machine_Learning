# Machine_Learning
repository for all my personal projects and studies of machine learning and artificial inteligence

This project was created to improve my knoledges on machine learning. In this first attempt, I created a algorithm that tries to predict if there will be a wildfire or not.
for this implementation I used google colab and extracted the database from kaggle.
The training and test data are in the file database_fires.csv, the data I am trying to predict are in resposta.csv and the best result is in dados.csv
